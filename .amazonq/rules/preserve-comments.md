# Code Preservation Rules

## CRITICAL: Never remove commented code
- NEVER remove any commented code (lines starting with //, /*, #, etc.)
- NEVER remove any user's existing code including test cases
- Only remove code if explicitly requested by the user
- When modifying files, preserve all existing comments and commented-out code blocks
- Treat commented code as intentional and important for the user's workflow
